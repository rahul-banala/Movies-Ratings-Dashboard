# Movies-Ratings-Dashboard

I made this app just to re apply my old R programming skills to a shiny app that allows users to input a year and receive a bar chart of all the movies of a particular genre that were made that year. I also provide a top 10 list of movies of that chosen year organized by user ratings.

All data used in this project are pulled from: https://datasets.imdbws.com/
